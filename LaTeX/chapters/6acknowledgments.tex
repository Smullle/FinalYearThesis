Iâ€™d like to extend my gratitude to my supervisor Dr Diarmuid O'Donoghue, for first introducing the idea and providing help and guidance whenever needed. I am grateful for the work done by the Sense2Vec team and the provided documentation for their project. Also of course all friends and family who provided helpful input and suggestions throughout the project.

\section*{COVID-19}
On the 13th of March 2020 the University closed due to a government recommendation because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost all code to produce results for the project was completed by this stage, however only provisional results were also logged at this time. The following week on the 20th of March all students were instructed to study and complete their work form home, at this time the two models used in this project were stored on an external hard drive for producing results at a later stage. However a few days later when running the code to produce the results it was found that combined; the models were approximately 8GB and once loaded into memory would exceed the RAM capacity of the available home PC. It was decided to migrate the processing of the results to Google Cloud, this process required two extra days of work to get the systems in place including uploading the models and creating new Python environments.
