# Sense2Vec: Investigating the Advantage of Introducing Part of Speech Tagging When Training Word Embeddings

A final year project investigating two methods for training word embeddings; Word2Vec and 
[Sense2Vec](https://github.com/explosion/sense2vec). Included are the 3 files used to produce the values used within 
Chapter 4 results; [BloomsTanonomy.py](../../BloomsTaxonomy.py), 
[ResultsCsv.py](../../ResultsCsv.py) and 
[RanWordsTxt.py](../../RanWordsTxt.py).

To produce the boxplots in sections 4.6 and 4.7 the following R files were used; [WordnetNoun.r](../../WordnetNoun.r),
[WordnetVerb.r](../../WordnetVerb.r) and [bloom.r](../../bloom.r)
